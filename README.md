# Starbucks Capstone Challenge: Brewing Insights from Customer Data â˜•ðŸ“Š

Welcome to the Starbucks Capstone Challenge! This project is all about diving into Starbucks' customer and offer data to uncover insights that can help improve their marketing strategies. Whether you're a data science enthusiast, a coffee lover, or just someone who enjoys a good analysis, this project has something for you. Let's get brewing!

## What's This All About?

Starbucks wants to know: How do customers interact with their offers? Are some offers more effective than others? Do certain groups of customers respond better to specific types of offers? To answer these questions, weâ€™re analyzing three datasets:

- **Portfolio**: Details about Starbucks' offers (e.g., BOGO, discounts, etc.).
- **Profile**: Demographic data about Starbucks customers (e.g., age, income, gender).
- **Transcript**: Records of customer interactions (e.g., offers received, viewed, completed, and transactions).

Our goal is to clean, explore, and analyze this data to uncover patterns and insights that can help Starbucks tailor their offers to the right customers.

## Whatâ€™s in This Repo?

Hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll find in this project:

### Notebooks:

- **Starbucks_Capstone.ipynb**: The main Jupyter notebook where all the magic happens. It includes data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and analysis.
- **(Optional) Starbucks_Modeling.ipynb**: If youâ€™re into machine learning, this notebook dives into predictive modeling.

### Data:

- **portfolio.json**: Offer details.
- **profile.json**: Customer demographics.
- **transcript.json**: Customer interactions.

### README.md: This file! Itâ€™s your guide to the project.

## How Does It Work?

Hereâ€™s a quick rundown of the steps we took:

### Load and Explore the Data:

We started by loading the datasets and taking a quick look at what weâ€™re working with. Spoiler: Thereâ€™s a lot of interesting stuff here!

### Clean and Prep the Data:

We cleaned up missing values, converted data types, and one-hot encoded categorical variables to make the data analysis-ready.

### Explore the Data:

We visualized customer demographics (age, income, gender) and behavior (transactions, offer interactions) to understand who Starbucksâ€™ customers are and what theyâ€™re doing on the app.

### Combine Data and Analyze Offers:

We merged the datasets to analyze how different customer groups respond to different offers. Whoâ€™s completing the most offers? Which offers are the most effective? Weâ€™ve got answers!

### Visualize Insights:

We used heatmaps, bar charts, and scatter plots to make the insights pop. Because who doesnâ€™t love a good visualization?

## Key Insights

Here are some of the cool things we discovered:

### Customer Demographics:

- Most Starbucks app users are middle-aged (30-50 years old) and earn moderate incomes (50kâˆ’100k).
- The gender distribution is fairly balanced, with slightly more female users.

### Offer Performance:

- BOGO (Buy One Get One) and discount offers are the most popular, with high completion rates.
- Middle-aged, medium-income females are the most likely to complete offers.

### Customer Behavior:

- Customers tend to spend consistently over time, with no clear spikes or dips in transaction amounts.
- Most offers are received and viewed, but not all are completed. This suggests room for improvement in offer design or targeting.

## How to Run This Project

Want to dive into the data yourself? Hereâ€™s how:

### Clone the Repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/starbucks-capstone.git
cd starbucks-capstone
Set Up Your Environment:
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.

Install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Notebook:
Open the Jupyter notebook (Starbucks_Capstone.ipynb) and start exploring!

Whatâ€™s Next?
This project is just the beginning. Here are some ideas for taking it further:

Predictive Modeling: Build a model to predict which customers are most likely to complete an offer.
A/B Testing: Simulate A/B tests to evaluate the effectiveness of different offers.
Customer Segmentation: Use clustering techniques to group customers based on behavior and demographics.
